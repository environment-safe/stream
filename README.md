@environment-safe/stream
============================
Just a uniform way to include streams

Usage
-----

```js
import {
    ReadableStream,
    ReadableStreamDefaultReader,
    ReadableStreamDefaultController,
    WritableStream,
    WritableStreamDefaultWriter,
    WritableStreamDefaultController,
    TransformStream,
    TransformStreamDefaultController,
    ByteLengthQueuingStrategy,
    CountQueuingStrategy,
    ReadableStreamBYOBReader,
    ReadableByteStreamController,
    ReadableStreamBYOBRequest
} from '@environment-safe/stream';
```

Testing
-------

Run the es module tests to test the root modules
```bash
npm run import-test
```
to run the same test inside the browser:

```bash
npm run browser-test
```
to run the same test headless in chrome:
```bash
npm run headless-browser-test
```

to run the same test inside docker:
```bash
npm run container-test
```

Run the commonjs tests against the `/dist` commonjs source (generated with the `build-commonjs` target).
```bash
npm run require-test
```

Development
-----------
All work is done in the .mjs files and will be transpiled on commit to commonjs and tested.

If the above tests pass, then attempt a commit which will generate .d.ts files alongside the `src` files and commonjs classes in `dist`
